  <h1>Light Switch</h1>

  <p>This example demonstrates one of the most basic state machines that are
    actually doing something useful: a light switch that can be turned on and
    off, and repeatedly.</p>

  <p>
    When the <em>operate</em> event is raised, the light switch changes back and
    forth between the <strong>On</strong> and <strong>Off</strong> states.
